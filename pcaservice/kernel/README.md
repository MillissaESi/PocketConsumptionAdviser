# Recommendation system 

For this prototype, a data set was generated from Junction K group data set by adding randomly a wast quantity number for a given row. Besides, a client ID was generated to develop a close technical solution to the main solution described in Dema.
A regression model was used to predict the client behaviour and recommend the right quantity of food to buy.
